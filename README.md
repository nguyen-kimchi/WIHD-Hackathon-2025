## Theme

**"Turning Data into Decisions: Women’s Health"**

Women’s health has historically been underrepresented in healthcare research, policy, and delivery — from conditions like endometriosis and menopause to disparities in screening, mental health, and maternity outcomes.

This hackathon invites early-career analysts to dive into data and spotlight the realities of women’s health in the NHS. How can we visualise better care, access, and outcomes for women? And how can we use data to drive positive change?

<a id="about"></a>

## What this Hackathon is about
A supportive, hands-on event designed for junior analysts, apprentices, and new starters. Whether you're just getting comfortable with pivot tables or exploring your first Power BI dashboard - this is your space to learn, create, and connect.

You’ll work in small teams to explore real datasets, build visual stories, and share what you find. No coding required. Just curiosity, collaboration, and a desire to turn data into something meaningful.

## The Challenge Focus
Below are the overall themes for your Hackathon challenge! We have suggested a few questions you could focus on during your hackathon under each theme. You may choose to focus on specific questions we have given or answer other questions you had in mind under the theme.  

**Access, Outcomes & Inequality**
- Are there disparities in screening uptake (e.g., cervical, breast) by region, age, or deprivation level?
- How do gynaecological waiting times compare across the country?
- What do maternal outcomes look like across different ethnicities or regions?
- How accessible are reproductive and menopause services?

**Women’s Mental Health & Wellbeing**

- Are women more likely to experience certain mental health conditions?
- Are perinatal mental health services reaching those most in need?
- How do self-harm and suicide rates vary for women over time?
- What does the data tell us about referrals, access, or satisfaction?

**System Gaps, Policy & Progress**

- Where is progress being made in addressing women’s health issues — and where is it stalled?
- Which conditions affecting women (e.g., endometriosis, PCOS) are least visible in current data?
- Are there correlations between policy changes and improved access or equity?
- What trends can we visualise that highlight unmet needs?

Use visual tools to explore the answers and make them clear, engaging, and impactful.
